<li>Reduce incidental complexity in large programs</li>
<li>Demonstrate new/improved "programming tools" - ie. support of concurrency</li>
<li>Develop competency in Functional Programming by Practice</li>
<li>Understanding the origins of FP concepts in Lisp, Javascript, Swift, Scala, C#, etc</li>
<li>Fun with pair programming and learning</li>
</ul>

<h1>HSLIDE</h1>

<h3>What you will get</h3>

<ul>
<li>Practical guidance on how to learn and apply FP practice to your work</li>
<li>Support and mentoring from XM and larger community</li>
<li>Prizes, glory and fame !</li>
</ul>

<h3>Historical Background &amp; Contex</h3>

<ul>
<li>Important to understand the approaches taken as computers were designed</li>
<li>Theory of Computation
<ul>
<li>The imperative and functional models grew out of work undertaken
Alan Turing, Alonzo Church, Stephen Kleene, Emil Post, etc. ~1930s
different formalizations of the notion of an algorithm, or effective procedure, based on automata, symbolic manipulation, recursive function definitions, and combinatorics
These results led Church to conjecture that any intuitively appealing model of computing would be equally powerful as well
this conjecture is known as Churchâ€™s thesis</li>
