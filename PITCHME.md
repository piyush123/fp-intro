- Improve the practice's knowledge base for FP
- Reduce incidental complexity in large programs
- Demonstrate new/improved "programming tools" - ie. support of concurrency
- Develop competency in Functional Programming by Practice
- Understanding the origins of FP concepts in Lisp, Javascript, Swift, Scala, C#, etc
- Fun with pair programming and learning

### Historical Background & Context ###

- Important to understand the approaches taken as computers were designed
- Theory of Computation was formalized in the 1930s by several pioneers including Turing, Church, Kleene

#VSLIDE

- The imperative and functional models grew out of work undertaken Alan Turing, Alonzo Church, Stephen Kleene, Emil Post, etc. ~1930s  different formalizations of the* notion of an algorithm*,* or *effective procedure*, based on *automata*, *symbolic manipulation*, *recursive function definitions*, and *combinatorics*

#VSLIDE

- 1933 Godel/Herbrand develop formal model for general recursive functions
- 1936 Church publishes λ-calculus.
- 1936 Turing creates theoretical model for computing machines
- These results led Church to conjecture that any intuitively appealing model of computing would be equally powerful as well this conjecture is known as Church’s thesis
- This became the basis for modern computation, a formal Theory of Computing!

Reviews
"Turns out the border between genius and insanity is a pretty cheery place."
—Paul Graham

"If for no other reason, you should buy Land of Lisp because of the extreme levels of unadulterated nerdery filling its pages. This book will appeal to the long-time Lisper and the neophyte."
—Michael Fogus, author of The Joy of Clojure and Functional JavaScript

"By choosing to teach Common Lisp using 1980s style text games the author has come up with an original and clever idea that avoids all the usual boring examples found in computer language books."
—John Graham-Cumming, author of The Geek Atlas

"To be honest, I just bought the book for enjoyment but I find myself getting a new perspective and learning more about Common Lisp. Recommended!"
—Mark Watson, author of Scripting Intelligence
