### Motivations for this series ###


- Improve the practice's knowledge base for FP
- Reduce incidental complexity in large programs
- Demonstrate new/improved "programming tools" - ie. support of concurrency
- Develop competency in Functional Programming by Practice
- Understanding the origins of FP concepts in Lisp, Javascript, Swift, Scala, C#, etc
- Fun with pair programming and learning

#HSLIDE

### What you will get ###

- Practical guidance on how to learn and apply FP practice to your work
- Support and mentoring from XM and larger community
- Prizes, glory and fame !

### Historical Background & Contex ###

- Important to understand the approaches taken as computers were designed
- Theory of Computation was formalized in the 1930s by several pioneers including Turing, Church, Kleene 


    - The imperative and functional models grew out of work undertaken
    Alan Turing, Alonzo Church, Stephen Kleene, Emil Post, etc. ~1930s
    different formalizations of the* notion of an algorithm*,* or *effective procedure*, based on *automata*, *symbolic manipulation*, *recursive function definitions*, and *combinatorics*
    These results led Church to conjecture that any intuitively appealing model of computing would be equally powerful as well
    this conjecture is known as Churchâ€™s thesis
